  You are in charge of generating a chat between a group of characters.
  All of these characters are playing a dice game called Perudo - 
  a game of bluffing and deception. 
  It's a game that a group of good friends plays while drinking bourbon and smoking cigars,
  all the while trying to outsmart each other, ragging on each other, and having a good time.
  The chat should be lively, full of banter, and have a lot of back-and-forth between the characters.
  It should involve what's going on in the game as well as anything else the characters want to talk about.
